                    <h2>Full-Stack Developer</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p align="justify">
                    A full-stack developer is a developer or engineer who can build 
                    both the front end and the back end of a website. The front end 
                    (the parts of a website a user sees and interacts with) and the 
                    back end (the behind-the-scenes data storage and processing) 
                    require different skill sets. Since full-stack developers are 
                    involved with all aspects of the development process, they must 
                    have expertise in both. A full-stack developer can work in-house 
                    or at a computer development company that engineers websites, 
                    software, and other components for other businesses. Full-stack 
                    developers design and create websites and applications for various 
                    platforms. A full-stack developer‚Äôs job description might include 
                    Develop and maintain web services and interfaces
                    Contribute to front-end and back-end development processes
                    Build new product features or APIs
                    Perform tests, troubleshoot software, and fix bugs
                    Collaborate with other departments on projects and sprints
                    The world of full-stack development is large, and many new and 
                    evolving technologies continually push the limits of what a 
                    full-stack developer can create. Staying on top of cutting-edge 
                    technology and techniques in the full-stack development field is 
                    one of the many exciting aspects of working in this role. 
                    Full-stack developers may be creative, graphically inclined, 
                    internet- and tech-savvy, and have excellent attention to detail. 
                    You‚Äôll want to learn the following skills to have a career in 
                    full-stack development:
                    <hr>
                    <h2>Frontend Developer</h2>
                    <hr>    
                    Front-end development is the process of creating the interface 
                    of a website. It entails coding details like drop-down menus, 
                    fonts, colors, and page layouts. Full-stack developers should 
                    also know how to work with front-end technologies like HTML, 
                    CSS, and scripting languages such as JavaScript to make websites 
                    and applications visually viable and appealing.
                    <hr>
                    <h2>Backend Developer</h2>
                    <hr>
                    Back-end development skills entail using back-end programming 
                    languages like Python, PHP, Ruby on Rails, and CakePHP and 
                    understanding how algorithms and business logic work.
                    <hr>
                    <h2>Web Design</h2>
                    <hr>
                    Web design includes using software such as Photoshop to create 
                    and design graphics and themes. It‚Äôll be helpful to familiarize 
                    yourself with basic UI (user interface) design principles to 
                    help you create navigational elements, backgrounds, and audio 
                    and video elements.
                    <hr>
                    <h2>Database Management</h2>
                    <hr>
                    Database management skills are required for full-stack developers, 
                    though it is part of the skills needed for back-end web 
                    development. A full-stack developer should be able to design, 
                    understand, and manipulate database queries and web storage.
                    A career in full-stack development combines creativity with 
                    analysis. As a full-stack developer, you‚Äôll have plenty of 
                    opportunities to learn and implement innovative principles 
                    in your work.
